## A personal introduction

First thing, I'm a hacker and I love to code.
I have more than 10 years of experience building things and working on projects 
with PHP, Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS but also with Javascript, Ruby, 
Java and some ASP.NET. I 'm not considering myself separately as a back-end or 
front-end developer because I did work on both parts on different projects.

I've also did some non web projects like a distributed HTTP sniffer or a drawing 
photo-album retouching & composer so I understand different environments and 
platforms.

I consider myself as a polyglot developer as I can code fluently in various 
languages like Golang, PHP, Python, Javascript or Java but also I have knowledge 
of other languages like C#, Ruby, C, Coffescript etc …

Since almos three years ago my focus has been on working on distributed systems, 
microservices based architectures and APIs using Golang as my first language of 
choice.
I’ve been also giving some talks on different meetups in London and Barcelona 
regarding message systems, microservice based development and Golang tips and 
tricks.

## What I'm looking for?

Considering that I've worked both in start-ups, public and private companies, 
and I have an experience of 9 years doing freelancing I'm not looking for some 
simple job or position:

My current priorities looking for a job are:

* To be involved in a great project that will attract me.
* To have possibilities to increase both my skills & my career in different 
* technologies and business areas.
* I prefer to work on “products” than on “services”.
* A good and appropriate salary of course ;)

As part of Smile Group I have two roles on this job.
One is to be a Project Manager ( Technical Project Manager indeed ) on big 
e-Commerce websites so my responsibilities begin with estimating costs and 
resources needed to build a project reporting directly to the projects director. 
Also when the project starts I act as a Team Leader estimating all tasks to be 
done, delegating them to my team of programmers and designers to accomplish 
times and deadlines estimated on the first step.

My day work being a Team Leader involves about 60% of development, testing and 
quality assurance of every task and about 40% on reporting to the customer and 
the projects director.

Also I'm the responsible to do the consequent formation to the customer, 
organize all external suppliers needed on the project and define the work flow 
for all my team.

We work with decoupled teams of back-end developers in Ukraine and front-end 
developers in Casablanca. So a common team is composed by two front-end 
developers, three or four PHP back-end developers and me as a Team Leader.

and team leaders to start whole new line on projects based on OpenERP ( 
Opensource ERP written in Python http://www.openerp.com ).

existing workflow to the new product.

We already successfully implanted 3 big projects at Spain with this technology 
both including a full feature ERP replacement with Purchases, Sales, Production, 
CRM & Project management, and of course Accounting.

Netsuus Intelligence was an startup focused on web analytics. They hired me 
after I showed him a prototype of a distributed job scheduling platform built on 
my spare time for a project I didn't rise money to start my own start up.

They liked my idea, so I adapted my platform as their MVP product. It consisted 
on a distributed HTTP sniffer where all clients where coded in Ruby ( using 
libpcap ) and a central storage using Hadoop & Lucene.

All transport from clients to the data center was managed through a series of 
intelligent webservices based on queues and written on Mono ( .NET platform ) 
platform on Linux servers.  Something like Microsoft WCF ( Windows Communication 
Framework ) or Amazon SQS ( Amazon Simple Queue Service ) because on that time 
those tools didn't exist yet.

We got clients sniffing their HTTP activity on all major universities and some 
commercial ISPs in Spain. So all data was anonymized ( to ensure privacy and 
LOPD spanish law ) before storage on central data center. Also we passed an 
external audit on that source code for this purpose.

Also, I developed a few web tools to analyze all raw data on the wharehouse or 
build reports based on result data. The final product of Netsuus, was these 
reports selled mainly to high websites and online companies like travel or 
coupons in Spain.

Their main focus was to compete with Nielsen Ratings or Compete.com on Spanish 
Market. They raised money and had activity for almost 4 years but they closed 
his operations on the fifth year.
